                We replace initial interviews and traditional questions with our
                interview bot, AIVA. AIVA acts as our pre-hiring assessment and
                evaluates candidates based on their compatibility to the jobâ€™s
                required skills. This allows us to know more about the
                candidates at first sight while also giving candidates a chance
                to show their true capabilities without the first interview
                nerves.
